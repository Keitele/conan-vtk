Conan recipe for the VTK library.

This recipe was only tested on Linux.


To use it, clone this repository and run the command below from the recipe folder.
#+begin_src bash
conan create . --build=missing -s build_type=Release
#+end_src

This will download vtk and install it in your conan cache.
You can run the command
#+begin_src bash
conan search vtk
#+end_src
to search for vtk in your local cache and confirm it was indeed installed.

After that, just add vtk to your dependencies and conan should find the version in your local cache.

If you have a local conan repository (see [[https://docs.conan.io/en/1.6/uploading_packages/artifactory_ce.html][this link]]) you can also upload the recipe to it
after it is installed in your local cache with the command below
#+begin_src bash
conan upload vtk -r=your_conan_repo
#+end_src
If you also want to upload the binary (such that subsequent installs from this repository
do not need to compile vtk) also pass the option ~--all~ to the above command.
